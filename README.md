Stream Uploader Proxy Servlet
-----------------------------
This project consists of simple Servlet, packaged in a WAR file ready to be deployed in JBoss 7.x AS or
[Torquebox](http://torquebox.org/documentation/). The stream is guaranteed to be 1KB wide, so its memory footprint is
quite ridiculous. And it's fast. Moreover, no external Java libraries are used.

### The problem
While all the cool kids in Ruby are busy streaming stuff
[from the server](http://www.intridea.com/blog/2012/5/24/building-streaming-rest-apis-with-ruby), there are other equally
cool kids who just want to stream stuff *to* the server. But, is it possible to accomplish this task using *only* Ruby web frameworks?
 And more importantly: if Rack is the de-facto engine for writing web frameworks in Ruby, is it enough? The answer is ["no it is not"](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rack-devel/P8oOycVBaH0), although good progress is being made in finding a decent, stream-friendly [successor](https://github.com/tenderlove/the_metal)

#### Bad news:
Stream-uploading big files with Ruby Rack 1.x [is impossible](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/rack-devel/T5YE-aFzSIQ).
The Problem is that [Rack would read the entire request body into memory](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3027564), and there
are no obvious ways to interact with raw requests and responses in this framework. AFAIK, to accomplish this task, people
just use non-Ruby stuff, such as Node.js, JavaEE or even the venerable FastCGI. And if you still don't believe me, just
[read this](http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2012/06/why-your-web-framework-should-not-adopt-rack-api/).

Under Ruby, instead of monkey-patching Rack, many people use [Goliath](https://github.com/postrank-labs/goliath). Goliath handles streaming,
[differently](https://github.com/postrank-labs/goliath/wiki/Streaming), even though it's Rack-based. But if you stick with your favorite
Rack-based framework, perhaps you could use JRuby and [jcommons-rack-upload](https://github.com/cowboyd/jcommons-rack-upload), which
wraps `env['rack.input']` with a rewindable `java.io.ByteArrayInputStream`. But alas, this later approach is just another monkey-patch.

### Motivations
In my case, the motivation came from Trantor, an internal doc archiving system we are developing. Trantor is distributed,
so the web front-end and API (Sinatra/Rack app) lives in a different server than the file server back-end (another Sinatra/Rack app).
The front-end app also hosts a `FileServiceProxy < Sinatra::Base` proxy for the GET, DELETE, OPTIONS and HEAD XMLHttpRequest:s
coming from the HTML5 client, which uses [jQuery-File-Upload](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload). Because of
the limitations of Rack mentioned above, the POST requests (file creation) must be routed through the Servlet.

Last but not least, I wanted to learn how to use Mockito to test Servlets. I ended up using PowerMockito (PowerMock + Mockito)
because Mockito by itself won't allow mocking final classes, such as Java's `URL`.

#### Supported streaming modes
The client can send files in three ways:

* x-www-form-urlencoded (either one or multiple files)
* Single-file binary streams with known or unknown content-length.


### Caveats
Please be aware, that there is Trantor-specific code living under `cc.abstra.trantor.wcamp` that takes care of:
* Document metadata archiving after a successful POST from the API
* Forwarding the request's OAuth 2.0 credentials to the OmniAuth middleware living in the front-end and processing authorization responses.

Delete this package and the references to its classes from your clone.

### Configure it
Its configuration is done via `src/main/webapp/web.xml` is simple:

```xml
…
  <servlet>
    …
    <init-param>
      <param-name>targetUri</param-name>
      <param-value>http://remotehost:9090/files</param-value>
    </init-param>
  </servlet>
…
```

The resulting WAR will be deployed at the `/uploader` context. If you wish to change it, then edit `src/main/webapp/jboss-web.xml`.

### Build it
This is a Maven 3 project. Mosey along: `mvn clean package`. Please make sure (Open)JDK 1.7 is installed and used (ie. update-alternatives).

### Deploy it (JBoss 7 AS)
After the build process is complete, drop `target/stream-uploader.war` into `$JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments` or execute
`mvn -Plocal-deploy clean package` or `mvn -Premote-deploy -DremoteIp=a.b.c.d clean package`. See `pom.xml` for more details.

### TO-DO
* More tests
* Support [chunked file uploads](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Chunked-file-uploads)
* Support for [XHR2](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/xhr2/) upload modes

### Credits
The inspiration came from [this StackOverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2471799) and I stole good implementation
 ideas from the [HTTP-Proxy-Servlet](https://github.com/dsmiley/HTTP-Proxy-Servlet) GitHub project by dsmiley. The `HttpHeaders`
 class comes from the Guava project and `MockServletInputStream` comes from [two-tiers-utils](https://github.com/DomDerrien/two-tiers-utils)
